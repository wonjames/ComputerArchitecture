## PROJECT 1
In this assignment you will examine a program consisting of a number of functions - labelled ques1.c to ques15.c -- each of which tests your knowledge of bitwise C operations. Your goal is to determine what each function does and if there
is a simpler way to implement the function. There are two parts to the requirements.

Assume 32 bit integers.

PART A: You need to determine what each function is doing .
You have to determine what each function is doing WITHOUT running the code. You must provide an explanation for your answer - 
you will get no credit if you correctly identify the function but provide  an incorrect or insufficient/incomplete explanation.
Once you determine the function, you should run the code to check your answer.
To run the code to test your function, you will need to insert appropriate C code to call the function and print out the result.
Once you are done showing what each function does, you should then answer part b.

PART B: For each function, can you write a simpler equivalent function in C (using any C operators) that produces the same result.
By simpler, we are interested in fewer operations in C but also more readable code.

 As an example, consider the answers to function ques0 - which you worked out in class.

 HANDIN Instructions: You must write out your answers to Part A in a report to be submitted (as a tarfile or zipfile, along with your code) - 
 in addition to the report, you can include comments in your code that may provide a secondary explanation (in case
 your report has errors). You MUST provide an explanation for what the function does and justify your answer. 
 Simply providing an example is NOT an explanation - so don't expect any credit if
 your answers are simply a collection of examples or code comments. 
 You are welcome to provide formal proofs where appropriate, 
 but use your judgement on whether to pursue a formal proof or not. 
 It is preferable to write your answers as comments in the code - but do not feel pressured to do so.
 For part B, write out your code in this file with the answer 
 (a simpler code if it exists) after each of the assigned functions in a manner similar to the example shown in ques0.c 
 (i.e., the answer to function ques7.c should be named ans7.c).

 IMPORTANT: The code you submit must compile correctly (using gcc). If the code you submit does not compile without errors, 
 you will get a zero for Part B of this project.

 GRADING: Each question has a specific number of points (i.e., not all questions have the same level of difficulty). 
 Your grade will be based on the correctness of your answer, 
 expressing the answer as a logical function where possible, and the efficiency and readability of your rewritten code.

 Collaboration: You can discuss the project with your teammate. 
 You CANNOT refer to online sources to get help; you can refer to the C syntax documentations. 
 Your report must include names of both members of the team -- 
 failure to do so would imply you are claiming you worked on your own, and may constitute a violation of academic integrity policies.
